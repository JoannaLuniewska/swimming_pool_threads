A **multithreaded Java Swing simulation** of a swimming center where clients queue at a cashier and are directed to appropriate pools based on age, VIP status, and special conditions (e.g. with guardian or diapers).

The interface dynamically shows:

-  The queue of clients waiting at the cashier  
-  Real-time pool assignments (Olympic, Recreational, or Toddler pool)  
-  Priority handling for VIP clients  
-  Status of the center (open/closed)  

This project demonstrates **multithreading**, **concurrency control** (synchronized, wait/notify), and **live GUI updates** using Java Swing.
